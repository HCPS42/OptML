# Automatic differentiation

## {.plain}
![This is not autograd](avtograd.jpeg){width=65%}

## Problem

Suppose we need to solve the following problem:

$$
L(w) \to \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d}
$$

. . .

* Such problems typically arise in machine learning, when you need to find optimal hyperparameters $w$ of an ML model (i.e. train a neural network). 
* You may use a lot of algorithms to approach this problem, but given the modern size of the problem, where $d$ could be dozens of billions it is very challenging to solve this problem without information about the gradients using zero-order optimization algorithms. 
* That is why it would be beneficial to be able to calculate the gradient vector $\nabla_w L = \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_d}\right)^T$. 
* Typically, first-order methods perform much better in huge-scale optimization, while second-order methods require too much memory.

## Finite differences

The naive approach to get approximate values of gradients is **Finite differences** approach. For each coordinate, one can calculate the partial derivative approximation:

$$
\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_k} (w) \approx \dfrac{L(w+\varepsilon e_k) - L(w)}{\varepsilon}, \quad e_k = (0, \ldots, \underset{{\tiny k}}{1}, \ldots, 0)
$$

. . .

:::{.callout-question}
If the time needed for one calculation of $L(w)$ is $T$, what is the time needed for calculating $\nabla_w L$ with this approach?

. . .

**Answer** $2dT$, which is extremely long for the huge scale optimization. Moreover, this exact scheme is unstable, which means that you will have to choose between accuracy and stability.

. . .

:::{.callout-theorem}
There is an algorithm to compute $\nabla_w L$ in $\mathcal{O}(T)$ operations. [^1]

## Forward mode automatic differentiation

To dive deep into the idea of automatic differentiation we will consider a simple function for calculating derivatives: 

$$
L(w_1, w_2) = w_2 \log w_1 + \sqrt{w_2 \log w_1}
$$

. . .

Let's draw a *computational graph* of this function:

![Illustration of computation graph of primitive arithmetic operations for the function $L(w_1, w_2)$](comp_graph.pdf)

. . .

Let's go from the beginning of the graph to the end and calculate the derivative $\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}$.

## Forward mode automatic differentiation algorithm


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Suppose, we have a computational graph $v_i, i \in [1; N]$. Our goal is to calculate the derivative of the output of this graph with respect to some input variable $w_k$, i.e. $\dfrac{\partial v_N}{\partial w_k}$. This idea implies propagation of the gradient with respect to the input variable from start to end, that is why we can introduce the notation: 

. . .

$$
\overline{v_i} = \dfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial w_k}
$$

![Illustration of forward chain rule to calculate the derivative of the function $L$ with respect to $w_k$.](auto_diff_forward.pdf){width=80%}

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

* For $i = 1, \ldots, N$:
    * Compute $v_i$ as a function of its parents (inputs) $x_1, \ldots, x_{t_i}$:
        $$
        v_i = v_i(x_1, \ldots, x_{t_i})
        $$
    * Compute the derivative $\overline{v_i}$ using the forward chain rule:
        $$
        \overline{v_i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{t_i}\dfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j}\dfrac{\partial x_j}{\partial w_k}
        $$

. . .

Note, that this approach does not require storing all intermediate computations, but one can see, that for calculating the derivative $\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_k}$ we need $\mathcal{O}(T)$ operations. This means, that for the whole gradient, we need $d\mathcal{O}(T)$ operations, which is the same as for finite differences, but we do not have stability issues, or inaccuracies now (the formulas above are exact).

## Backward mode automatic differentiation

We will consider the same function with a computational graph:

![Illustration of computation graph of primitive arithmetic operations for the function $L(w_1, w_2)$](comp_graph.pdf)

. . .


Assume, that we have some values of the parameters $w_1, w_2$ and we have already performed a forward pass (i.e. single propagation through the computational graph from left to right). Suppose, also, that we somehow saved all intermediate values of $v_i$. Let's go from the end of the graph to the beginning and calculate the derivatives $\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}, \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_2}$:

## Backward (reverse) mode automatic differentiation

:::{.callout-question}
Note, that for the same price of computations as it was in the forward mode we have the full vector of gradient $\nabla_w L$. Is it a free lunch? What is the cost of acceleration?

. . .

**Answer** Note, that for using the reverse mode AD you need to store all intermediate computations from the forward pass. This problem could be somehow mitigated with the gradient checkpointing approach, which involves necessary recomputations of some intermediate values. This could significantly reduce the memory footprint of the large machine-learning model.

## Gradient propagation through the linear least squares

::: {.column width="40%"}

![$x$ could be found as a solution of linear system](linear_least_squares_layer.pdf)

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

Suppose, we have an invertible matrix $A$ and a vector $b$, the vector $x$ is the solution of the linear system $Ax = b$, namely one can write down an analytical solution $x = A^{-1}b$, in this example we will show, that computing all derivatives $\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial A}, \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial b}, \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial x}$, i.e. the backward pass, costs approximately the same as the forward pass.

. . .

It is known, that the differential of the function does not depend on the parametrization:

$$
dL = \left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial x}, dx \right\rangle = \left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial A}, dA \right\rangle + \left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial b}, db \right\rangle
$$

. . .

Given the linear system, we have:

$$
\begin{split}
Ax &= b \\
dAx + Adx = db &\to dx = A^{-1}(db - dAx)
\end{split}
$$

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

The straightforward substitution gives us:

$$
\left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial x}, A^{-1}(db - dAx) \right\rangle = \left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial A}, dA \right\rangle + \left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial b}, db \right\rangle
$$

. . .

$$
\left\langle -A^{-T}\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial x} x^T, dA \right\rangle + \left\langle A^{-T}\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial x},db \right\rangle = \left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial A}, dA \right\rangle + \left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial b}, db \right\rangle
$$

. . .

Therefore:

$$
\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial A} = -A^{-T}\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial x} x^T \quad \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial b} =  A^{-T}\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial x}
$$

. . .

It is interesting, that the most computationally intensive part here is the matrix inverse, which is the same as for the forward pass. Sometimes it is even possible to store the result itself, which makes the backward pass even cheaper.

Suppose, we have the rectangular matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, which has a singular value decomposition:

$$
W = U \Sigma V^T, \quad U^TU = I, \quad V^TV = I, \quad \Sigma = \text{diag}(\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_{\min(m,n)})
$$

1. Similarly to the previous example:

    $$
    \begin{split}
    W &= U \Sigma V^T \\
    dW &= dU \Sigma V^T + U d\Sigma V^T + U \Sigma dV^T \\
    U^T dW V &= U^TdU \Sigma V^TV + U^TU d\Sigma V^TV + U^TU \Sigma dV^TV \\
    U^T dW V &= U^TdU \Sigma + d\Sigma + \Sigma dV^TV
    \end{split}
    $$

2. Note, that $U^T U = I \to dU^TU + U^T dU = 0$. But also $dU^TU = (U^T dU)^T$, which actually involves, that the matrix $U^TdU$ is antisymmetric:

    $$
    (U^T dU)^T +  U^T dU = 0 \quad \to \quad \text{diag}( U^T dU) = (0, \ldots, 0)
    $$

    The same logic could be applied to the matrix $V$ and

    $$
    \text{diag}(dV^T V) = (0, \ldots, 0)
    $$

3. At the same time, the matrix $d \Sigma$ is diagonal, which means (look at the 1.) that

    $$
    \text{diag}(U^T dW V) = d \Sigma 
    $$

    Here on both sides, we have diagonal matrices.

4. Now, we can decompose the differential of the loss function as a function of $\Sigma$ - such problems arise in ML problems, where we need to restrict the matrix rank:

    $$

    dL &= \left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \Sigma}, d\Sigma \right\rangle \\
    &= \left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \Sigma}, \text{diag}(U^T dW V)\right\rangle \\
    &= \text{tr}\left(\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \Sigma}^T \text{diag}(U^T dW V) \right)
    \end{split}
    $$

5. As soon as we have diagonal matrices inside the product, the trace of the diagonal part of the matrix will be equal to the trace of the whole matrix:

    $$
    \begin{split}
    dL &= \text{tr}\left(\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \Sigma}^T \text{diag}(U^T dW V) \right) \\
    &= \text{tr}\left(\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \Sigma}^T U^T dW V \right)  \\
    &= \left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \Sigma}, U^T dW V \right\rangle \\
    &= \left\langle U \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \Sigma} V^T, dW \right\rangle 
    \end{split}
    $$

6. Finally, using another parametrization of the differential

    $$
    \left\langle U \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \Sigma} V^T, dW \right\rangle = \left\langle\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial W}, dW \right\rangle
    $$

    $$
    \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial W} =  U \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \Sigma} V^T,
    $$

    This nice result allows us to connect the gradients $\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial W}$ and $\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \Sigma}$.
